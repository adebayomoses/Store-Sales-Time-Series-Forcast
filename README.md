# Store-Sales-Time-Series-Forcast

## Objectives:

Using Time-series forecasting to forecast store sales on data from Corporaci√≥n Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer.

To build a model that more accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores.

# Data Exploration findings:
Finding patterns and relationships among the variables.

1. The plot indicates that a specific product category outperforms the others in terms of sales.

2. It's evident from the plot that the highest sales are concentrated in Quito and Guayaquil, which can be attributed to the increased promotional efforts in these cities.

3. The plot suggests a correlation between sales and the level of promotion. As sales decrease, promotional efforts intensify. However, as sales peak, less emphasis is placed on promotion. The correlation is not very strong since reduced promotion accompanies peak sales.

4. There seems to be a negative correlation with relatively low impact. As depicted in the plot, when oil prices range from 0 to 100, their influence on sales is most pronounced when sales are at their lowest. Conversely, as sales approach their peaks, the impact of oil prices diminishes.

5. The plot provides insights indicating that the company prioritizes overall revenue rather than the contribution of each product category.

6. Notably, the plot reveals that product families with more promotion significantly contribute to the total revenue. Conversely, product families with limited or no promotion make a smaller impact on the total sales. The majority of total revenue originates from promoted products.
