# Store-Sales-Time-Series-Forcast

## Objectives:

Using Time-series forecasting to forecast store sales on data from Corporaci√≥n Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer.

And build a model that more accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores.

# Findings Summary:
Finding patterns and relationships among the variables.

* Sales Distribution by Product Family:
  
Groceries and beverages stand out as the top contributors to total sales.
Automotive and lawn and garden product families contribute the least to overall sales.

* Impact of Promotion on Revenue:
  
Product families with higher promotion levels show a more significant contribution to total revenue.
Families with minimal or no promotion make lesser contributions, indicating the importance of promotional activities in driving sales.

* Oil Price Impact:
  
The influence of oil prices on sales is more pronounced at lower price ranges (0 to 100), particularly when sales are at their lowest.
As sales reach their peaks, the impact of oil prices diminishes.

* Correlation Between Sales and Promotion:
  
A negative correlation exists between sales and promotion, with sales peaking while promotion efforts decrease or become non-existent.


# Recommendations to Improve:

* Optimize Promotion Strategies:

Evaluate and refine promotion strategies for product families to ensure a balanced and effective approach.
Consider increasing promotions for product families with lower sales to stimulate growth.

* Diversify Product Offerings:

Explore opportunities to diversify product offerings, especially within the automotive and lawn and garden categories, to potentially boost sales.

* Monitor Oil Price Sensitivity:

Continuously monitor the sensitivity of sales to oil price fluctuations and adjust strategies accordingly.
Consider implementing targeted marketing efforts during periods of higher oil prices to mitigate potential negative effects.

* Sales Variation:

Tailor promotional strategies to local preferences and market dynamics.

* Customer Engagement Programs:
  
Implement customer engagement programs to enhance loyalty and encourage repeat purchases.
Leverage data on past sales and customer behavior to create personalized promotions.
