# Store-Sales-Time-Series-Forcast

## Objectives:

Using Time-series forecasting to forecast store sales on data from Corporaci√≥n Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer.

To build a model that more accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores.

# Data Exploration findings:
Finding patterns and relationships among the variables.

Findings Summary:

Sales Distribution by Product Family:

Groceries and beverages stand out as the top contributors to total sales.
Automotive and lawn and garden product families contribute the least to overall sales.
Impact of Promotion on Revenue:

Product families with higher promotion levels show a more significant contribution to total revenue.
Families with minimal or no promotion make lesser contributions, indicating the importance of promotional activities in driving sales.
Oil Price Impact:

The influence of oil prices on sales is more pronounced at lower price ranges (0 to 100), particularly when sales are at their lowest.
As sales reach their peaks, the impact of oil prices diminishes.
Correlation Between Sales and Promotion:

A negative correlation exists between sales and promotion, with sales peaking while promotion efforts decrease or become non-existent.
