# Store-Sales-Time-Series-Forcast

## Objectives:

Using Time-series forecasting to forecast store sales on data from Corporaci√≥n Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer.

To build a model that more accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores.

# Data Exploration ongoing
Finding patterns and relationships among the variables.
* The plot shows the type category that has higher sales compared to others

* The plot shows that the majority of the sales is made from Quito city and Guayaquil also contributed to the large sales.

The plot shows that more promotion was made at Quito city and Guayaquil, which might have resulted to the the large sales from these cities.

When the sales is low, the company make more promotion to boost sales. however, when the sales reach it peak, less promotion is made. Not strong a correlation because as the sales hit peakk, less to non promotion is made.

Negative correlation with less impact. from the plot , as the oil price move from 0 to 100, the effect on sales was when it was at it lowest. however as the sales moves towards its peaks, their are less impact from oil price.

from the plot above, the information shows that the company is likely to focus more on the over all revenue of the business than what each product category revenue contributed into the business.

The plot shows that product family with more promotion contributed more to the total revenue. and family product with little or no promotion, also contributed less to the total sales because majority of the total revenue came from the promoted products.
